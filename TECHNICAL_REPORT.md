# Technical Report: Player Re-identification System

## 1. Introduction

This report details the development and implementation of a player re-identification system for soccer video analysis. The system aims to maintain consistent player identities throughout a video sequence, even when players leave and re-enter the frame.

## 2. Approach and Methodology

### 2.1 Core Components

1. **Player Detection**
   - Custom-trained YOLO model (class ID 2 for soccer players)
   - Confidence threshold of 0.3 for reliable detection
   - Aspect ratio filtering (1.2-5.0) to reduce false positives
   - Minimum area threshold (500 pixels) for valid detections

2. **Feature Extraction**
   - 105-dimensional feature vector per player:
     - 96 color features (32 bins Ã— 3 channels)
     - 9 gradient features (HOG-like descriptors)
   - Feature normalization for consistent matching
   - Rolling feature buffer for temporal consistency

3. **Player Tracking**
   - Multi-stage tracking pipeline:
     1. Motion prediction using track history
     2. Feature matching with active players
     3. Re-identification of previously tracked players
   - Weighted combination of appearance and spatial features
   - Track history maintenance (30 frames)

4. **Re-identification Strategy**
   - Feature memory bank for disappeared players
   - Position-aware matching for re-appearing players
   - Cosine similarity for feature comparison
   - Two-stage matching process for optimal ID assignment

### 2.2 Implementation Details

1. **Feature Memory System**
   ```python
   def _update_feature_memory(self, player_id: int, features: np.ndarray):
       if player_id not in self.feature_memory:
           self.feature_memory[player_id] = []
       self.feature_memory[player_id].append(features)
       if len(self.feature_memory[player_id]) > self.feature_buffer_size:
           self.feature_memory[player_id].pop(0)
   ```

2. **Re-identification Logic**
   ```python
   def _match_with_inactive_players(self, detection: Dict) -> Optional[int]:
       detection_features = detection['features']
       detection_centroid = np.array(detection['centroid'])
       best_match_id = None
       best_match_score = -1
       
       for player_id, player_data in self.inactive_players.items():
           feature_similarity = self._calculate_feature_similarity(
               detection_features, 
               self._get_average_features(player_id)
           )
           position_score = np.exp(-position_distance / self.max_distance)
           combined_score = 0.7 * feature_similarity + 0.3 * position_score
           
           if combined_score > 0.75 and combined_score > best_match_score:
               best_match_score = combined_score
               best_match_id = player_id
       
       return best_match_id
   ```
